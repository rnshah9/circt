    The `pipeline.while` operation represents a statically scheduled
    pipeline stucture that executes while a condition is true. For more details,
    see: https://llvm.discourse.group/t/rfc-representing-pipelined-loops/4171.

    A pipeline captures the result of scheduling, and is not generally safe to
    transform, besides lowering to hardware dialects. For more discussion about
    relaxing this, see: https://github.com/llvm/circt/issues/2204.

    This is the top-level operation representing a high-level pipeline. It is
    not isolated from above, but could be if this is helpful. A pipeline
    contains two regions: `condition` and `stages`.

    The pipeline may accept an optional `iter_args`, similar to the SCF dialect,
    for representing loop-carried values like induction variables or reductions.
    When the pipeline starts execution, the registers indicated as `iter_args`
    by `pipeline.terminator` should be initialized to the initial
    values specified in the `iter_args` section here. The `iter_args` relate to
    the initiation interval of the loop. The maximum distance in stages between
    where an `iter_arg` is used and where that `iter_arg` is registered must be
    less than the loop's initiation interval. For example, with II=1, each
    `iter_arg` must be used and registered in the same stage.

    The single-block `condition` region dictates the condition under which the
    pipeline should execute. It has a `register` terminator, and the
    pipeline initiates new iterations while the registered value is `true : i1`.
    It may access SSA values dominating the pipeline, as well as `iter_args`,
    which are block arguments. The body of the block may only contain
    "combinational" operations, which are currently defined to be simple
    arithmetic, comparisons, and selects from the `Standard` dialect.

    The single-block `stages` region wraps `pipeline.stage`
    operations. It has a `pipeline.terminator` terminator, which can
    both return results from the pipeline and register `iter_args`. Stages may
    access SSA values dominating the pipeline, as well as `iter_args`, which are
    block arguments.

    This operation has a single-block region which dictates the operations that
    may occur concurrently.

    It has a `start` attribute, which indicates the start cycle for this stage.

    It may have an optional `when` predicate, which supports conditional
    execution for each stage. This is in addition to the `condition` region that
    controls the execution of the whole pipeline. A stage with a `when`
    predicate should only execute when the predicate is `true : i1`, and push a
    bubble through the pipeline otherwise.

    It has a `register` terminator, which passes the concurrently
    computed values forward to the next stage.

    Any stage may access `iter_args`. If a stage accesses an `iter_arg` after
    the stage in which it is defined, it is up to lowering passes to preserve
    this value until the last stage that needs it.

    Other than `iter_args`, stages may only access SSA values dominating the
    pipeline or SSA values computed by a previous stage. This ensures the stages
    capture the coarse-grained schedule of the pipeline and how values feed
    forward and backward.
